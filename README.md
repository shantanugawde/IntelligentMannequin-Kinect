# IntelligentMannequin
Proof of Concept Intelligent Mannequin using Microsoft Kinect

The project was developed as a winning solution to the Intelligent Mannequin problem given at CSI TechNext Hackathon. In a real-world scenario, a Kinect device connected to a computer would have to be placed on or near a mannequin.

Features developed are:

1) Count the number of people passing in front of the mannequin <br />
2) Count the number of interested people by checking if the person has stood in front of the mannequin for more than a certain period of time <br />
3) Click a picture if a person is interested and upload to Azure Cloud <br />
4) Analysis and graphing of emotions of interested people is done through a script <br />
